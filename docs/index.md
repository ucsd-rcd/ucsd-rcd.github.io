# Welcome

Welcome to the UC San Diego Research Computing & Data Community!

Research Computing and Data (RCD), also known as Cyberinfrastructure (CI), is a general term that refers to foundational research support areas. This community includes researchers and their collaboration partners, those RCD professionals who include data scientists, systems engineers, software developers, research librarians, data wranglers, research facilitators, and more.

Our meetings, mailing list, and other modes of communication will allow the research community to ask questions, discuss issues, and find solutions to research support challenges. Join the mailing list and "zoom" into the next meeting!
